	There was once a boy who was growing up in a very wealthy family. One day, his father decided to take him on a trip to show him how others lived who were less fortunate. His father’s goal was to help his son appreciate everything that he has been given in life.The boy and his father pulled up to a farm where a very poor family lived. They spent several days on the farm, helping the family work for their food and take care of their land.When they left the farm, his dad asked his son if he enjoyed their trip and if he had learned anything during the time they spent with this other family.The boy quickly replied, “It was fantastic, that family is so lucky!”</p>

	<p style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;">Life brings us as many joyful moments as it does downfalls, and although there are days we wish there was a manual to follow, it simply wouldn't be the same without the spontaneity. The journey of life may not become easier as we grow older, but we do seem to understand it better as our perspectives evolve</p>
